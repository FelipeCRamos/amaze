# AMAZE. A project for Linguagem de Programação I (LP I)

## Introduction

This programming project implements a sub-problem of the simulation over the **SNAZE** game, in thsi case, **AMAZE**.
###### Description of Amaze goes Here.

## Algorithms

Functions implemented for:

1. a.
2. b.
3. c.

## TODO

- [ ] Create (functional) Class Snake.
- [ ] Code function ....
- [ ] Code function ....
- [ ] Doxygen commentation.

## How to compile

First of all, obviously this repository is needed to work as desired, so we must to download this repo. As we know that ```git``` is a tremendous tool for any programmer, then we must have git installed.

It is also expected for user to have installed [doxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen) program. This will automatically generate documentation for code. Not a necessary package to compile and run program, but it is a tool to guide user through code functions. To install `doxygen` on UBUNTU, for example:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install doxygen
```
To compile we will use a makefile, so compilations may be more dynamic and automatic.
```bash
# Using 'git clone' to clone this repo into desired directory:
$ git clone https://github.com/FelipeCRamos/amaze.git

# Enter repo:
$ cd amaze

# To compile the whole project and also generate documentation, insert 'make' inside root of path:
$ make

# To clean up all remaining trash data and files, such as the binary ones, insert 'make clean':
$ make clean
```

## How to execute

Now, we show how to run the program. 
```bash
# To execute program:
$ ./amaze
```

### Example

Let's say you wish to..., then you write like....
```bash
$ ./amaze
```
It will result in....
